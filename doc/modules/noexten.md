# [MacAdamia Module](.) - No-Exten

It removes the extension from any files its route matches and removes the filename as well if it matches the *indexName*.

This is useful for removing the annoying *.html* and */index.html* from URLs, which makes them much nicer to look at.

## Options

 * *options.indexName* - the basename of files that should loose their extensions (*default*: index)
